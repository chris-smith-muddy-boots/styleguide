    <h2>Notifications</h2>
    <p>Alerts and Notifications appear at the top of the page.</p>
    <p><strong>1 - The in page Notification</strong></p>
    <p>This  alert is a a short text message which appears in a horizontal line  underneath the navigation. It remains until a user clicks on the cross  to close it.</p>
    <p>Consider a background colour of green, blue or red depending on the severity of the problem. </p>
<ul>
      <li>Green (#5BA546) - Positive mesages - no issues just a helpful tooltip highlighting a page function such as a 'did you know?'<br>
      </li>
      <li>Blue (#0082C8) - Informative messages - an alert about the status of something.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Amber (#FF8533) - Warning messages - not critical but a user may have to make a change</li>
      <li>Red (#CC0000) - Error messages - Use sparingly, this is a warning where a user needs to take action to resolve the problem.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>

        <h3>2 - Form Page Alert </h3>

In this case it informs the user that they are unable to change the form values as they have no privileges.

This is not a warning as nothing is wrong, there is no cross as its a message which can/may not need to be resolved but would always be viewed.</p>
