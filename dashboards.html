    <h2>Dashboards</h2>
    <p>The Dashboard is the first page the user sees after logging in. This will often show charts and data highlighted from the rest of the site.</p>

     <h3>Logi Charts</h3>
     <p>The logi charts should be on a white background.<br>
       <br>
Consider using the light green to break up a page area, useful for filters and widgets in the right hand column but also for tabs.<br>
A 1 pixel green outline helps to seperate the light green from the white.
       <br>
       The charts should use the core colours from the palette (listed below and in the <a href="colours.html">colour</a> page) 
       <br>
       Colour legends should be square with a minimum width of 16pixels. 
       

     </p>
     <p>Where there are lots of charts to display consider using tabs and/or display charts side by side. See example below.</p>
