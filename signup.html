    <h2>Signup and Login </h2>
    <p>The login page should contain much of the Greenlight Branding. It is a front cover to the application and should look inviting and friendly.</p>

    <h3>Generic Login Loading Page</h3>
    This should be used to inform the user what is happenening when the application starts up for the first time or from a long period of non us. 
This avoids a blank screen that appeared for s short period when some customers logged in.  
In this instance the Greenlight logo would be replaced by the relevant product application logo.

<h3>Mobile Login Page</h3>
    This is how the screen appears on an ipad. There is a larger green button for touchscreen users.  <p>

    <p>The flutters can be removed on iphones and ipad minis to reduce cluttering.</p>
