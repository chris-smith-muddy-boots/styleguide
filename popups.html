    <h2>Popups / Overlay</h2>
    <p>Popups are not new windows anymore but a window of information pulled to the front of the page, useful for important actions or alerts. <br>
<br>
Try to avoid popups where ever possible, they should be used sparingly. <br>
    Try and make these popup windows moveable.<br>
    Grey out the rest of the screen behind.<br>
    The popup is contained in a 10 pixel wide green border .</p>
