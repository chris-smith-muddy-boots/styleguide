    <h2>Logos</h2>
    <p>The overall Greenlight Logo is now updated and should look like part of the suite of products. However use of this logo is questionable as customers should refer to the individual product name for support.</p>
    <p><img src="images/logos/greenlight-logo.png" width="185" height="49" alt=""/></p>
    <p>The logos of the products in the Greenlight Suite should always be displayed in their entirety:</p>

<p><img src="images/logos/supplier-approval-logo.png" width="305" height="49" alt=""/><br><br>
  <img src="images/logos/quality-control-logo.png" width="305" height="49" alt=""/>  <br><br>
<img src="images/logos/grower-management-logo.png" width="305" height="49" alt=""/> </p>
<p><img src="images/logos/assessments-logo.png" width="305" height="49" alt=""/></p>
<p>Please do not deface any of the Greenlight product logos:<br>
Don’t recreate or change the elements of a logo or remove the product name</p>
<p> <img src="images/logos/wrong-changes.png" width="305" height="49" alt=""/></p>

</p>
<p> <img src="images/logos/grower-management-logo.png" width="251" height="27" alt=""/><br>
  <br>
Don’t change the colour of a logo</p>
<p><img src="images/logos/wrong-colour-logo.png" width="305" height="49" alt=""/></p>
 
     
    <p>The Greenlight product logos should always appear on a white background. If for any reason this is not possible please add a 10 pixel white guttering around the logo.</p>
