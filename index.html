    <h3>Introduction</h3>   
    <p>Our brand identity is the primary way in which we communicate Muddy Boots’ guiding philosophy and approach. An essential element of this identity is our Greenlight brand.</p>
    <p>Greenlight is a valuable asset to Muddy Boots because, through its unified styling, it demonstrates an integrated suite of products working for our customers at all levels of the supply chain.</p>
<p>This is a guide to the basic elements that make up the Greenlight style across web-based products. Please comply with these style guidelines across all Muddy Boots’ Greenlight products.</p>
    <p>Use the left hand menu to navigate around the elements in this styleguide. Where possible each element contains the appropriate snippets of html and css for developers to use.</p>
    <p>This styleguide is constantly updated.</p>
