    <h2>Sidebar</h2>
<p> The sidebar appears throughout the applications. It is light grey (#f1f1f1) although white is an acceptable alternative.</p>
<p>The sidebar can be used for page introduction text and contextual actions relating to the main body content such as filters, export options, <a href="help.html">help text </a>and links (secondary actions). These are displayed as green hypertext links.</p>
<p>At the top of the sidebar is a search function which helps to filter the results displayed on the page.</p>
<p>     Primary actions are buttons and these should always appear in the main screen area and not in the sidebar as shown in the example below.

    <h3>Hide/Show Sidebar</h3>
    <p> The sidebar can be hidden and shown by clicking the right arrow and ‘Hide sidebar’. This allows content to stretch to full screen, a useful benefit for customers on smaller screens who wish to view the larger table views.</p>
