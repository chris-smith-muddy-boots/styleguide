<h3>GM Mapping Colours</h3>
    <p>Do not customise the core colours of the Googlemap. <img src="images/mapping/mapping-supplychain.jpg" width="734" height="460" alt=""/>   
    Where possible use the satelite view. <br>
    Use white arrows on 2 pixel wide lines when required to show movement from site to site (such as products in the supply chain).<br>
    Use the core colours from the palette for pins. <br>
    Invert labels so they are white on a black background. This helps to differentiate between our labels and the existing places on Google maps.</p>

<h3>Marker for Google maps</h3>
<p>Greenlight Products use a white marker (also known as a pin) as default. Again this is font awesome, although these can all be exported to svg. Which is perfect when removing the 'hole' to add a letter to label the pin - In this example the letter A.</p>
