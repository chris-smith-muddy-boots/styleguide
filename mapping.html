    <h2>Mapping</h2>
    <p>This page outlines styles for using Google Maps API within the Greenlight Products.</p>

    <hr />

    <h3>The Map</h3>
    <p>Where possible use the HYBRID map type, which is satellite imagery with text labels, boundaries, major roads and places indicated.</p>
    <p>The pan, rotate and zoom controls are shown, others are hidden by default. The zoom control should be the small/mobile version.</p>

    <hr />

    <h3>Map Markers</h3>
    <p>Map markers, also known as pins, use the Font Awesome map marker icons. There are 2 versions, one with a hole and one solid. The version with the hole is the default version, the solid version is used when a character is placed on the marker.</p>
    <p>By default map markers are white (#fff) with black (#000) text but colours can change to other colours from the palette as needed. Text is 14px and bold.</p>
    <p>The label which shows a single character on a marker should always be a letter A-Z (and then a-z if more are needed) so as not to be confused with marker clusters.</p>

    <hr />

    <h3>Marker Clustering</h3>
    <p>Where several map markers are close together they should be replaced with a marker cluster - a circle which indicates the number of markers it replaces.</p>
    <p>By default this is white (#fff) with blue text (#08c). As with the markers, text is 14px and bold.</p>
    <img src="images/mapping/cluster.png" alt="marker cluster" />

    <hr />

    <h3>Lines and Arrows</h3>
    <p>Lines, called polylines in Google Maps, should always have a strokeWidth of 3 (3px thickness).</p>
    <p>Colour will depend on usage, e.g. the status of a chain, and can use the RAG colours, but is set as white (#fff) by default.</p>
    <p>If an arrow is required, the FORWARD_OPEN_ARROW Google Maps symbol should be used with the same colour as the line.</p>
    <p>The "geodesic" property, which uses the Earth's curvature in calculations rather than treating it as a flat 2D map, should be set to true. This usually results in slightly curved lines.</p>

    <hr />

    <h3>Shapes</h3>
    <p>Polygons, shapes made up of polylines, can use different colours but the default stroke colour is white (#fff). They should always have a strokeWidth of 3.</p>
    <p>By default there is no fill so that the detail inside can be seen clearly.</p>
    <p>The "geodesic" property should be set to true.</p>

    <hr />


    <h3>Default Settings Script</h3>
    <p>There is a script which sets all the default properties that should be used and even includes some SVG symbol paths and Data URIs for icons.</p>

<!--<h3>GM Mapping Colours</h3>
    <p>Do not customise the core colours of the Googlemap. <img src="images/mapping/mapping-supplychain.jpg" width="734" height="460" alt=""/>   
    Where possible use the satelite view. <br>
    Use white arrows on 2 pixel wide lines when required to show movement from site to site (such as products in the supply chain).<br>
    Use the core colours from the palette for pins. <br>
    Invert labels so they are white on a black background. This helps to differentiate between our labels and the existing places on Google maps.</p> 
    <hr>
<h3>Marker for Google maps</h3>
<p>Greenlight Products use a white marker (also known as a pin) as default. Again this is font awesome, although these can all be exported to svg. Which is perfect when removing the 'hole' to add a letter to label the pin - In this example the letter A.</p>
