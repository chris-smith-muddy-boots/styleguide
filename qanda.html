    <h2>Questions and answers</h2>
 
    
    <p><strong>Should pop-ups be locked or should a user be able to move them?</strong><br>
Pop-ups should be movable. </p>
    <p><strong>Should pop-ups include a cancel button as well as the x to close the pop up or just one or the other? If so, which? </strong><br>
All pop-ups should have a Save button and a Cancel button by default, unless otherwise specified in the requirements.	The positive action (green) should be first (on the left).</p>
    <p><strong>When you have a popup screen as the result of an edit function – should it show all fields with those that can’t be updated locked, or show just those fields that are updatable? </strong><br>
Edit screens should show all relevant information. This may include information which cannot be updated and is locked. </p>
    <p><strong>When you have a popup open and don’t close it but click onto the screen behind, should the popup remain open or should it close?</strong><br>
The user should not be able to click on the screen from which the pop up was triggered. The underlying screen should remain disabled while the pop-up is open, and the pop-up should contain an explicit action to close it. </p>
    <p><strong>When you click from a main screen into a pop-up via a function, when you leave the popup should the main page go back to the top or remain where it was when you selected the function next to e.g. a site?</strong><br>
It should remain where it was. </p>
    <p><strong>Layout of data entry screens and controls used – should we use pop-ups, separate screens, in-grid editing etc?</strong><br>
Pop-ups and separate screens are design decisions. Both have their place. A rule of thumb is to look at the amount of data that needs to be entered by the user. For example, if a large amount of data is to be added a separate screen may be more appropriate than a pop up. In-grid editing should be very carefully considered as this has the tendency to be non-standard web behaviour.</p>
    <p><strong>HTML Tables! What about controls?</strong><br>
The use of third-party controls should be carefully considered. For example, the removal of Telerik controls in Greenlight Grower Management and Greenlight Supplier Exchange has provided performance improvements, better control of page styling and also reduced the risk of incompatibility with new browsers.</p>
    <p><strong>I’ve just created a beautifully smooth transition on a lightbox, can I work this straight into a design? </strong><br>
We’re always looking for new techniques and design ideas but please flag it up first so that it can be reviewed. It may be that it can be used across all products but we will need to engage all product owners first.</p>
    <p><strong>Styling – Is there any scope for a customer logo? I know a number of customers are used to this and it does help test/support differentiate deployments.</strong><br>
Positioning of customer logos is a design decision – and may also be a commercial decision - but the use of a customer logo, a Muddy Boots logo and a Greenlight logo on the same page should be avoided so as not to overcrowd the page with logos. </p>
    <p><strong>Accessibility standards – should we always try and use alt tags?</strong><br>
Yes – accessibility standards should be adhered to. Accessibility standards are out of scope for this document but a good place to start is <a href="http://www.w3.org" target="_blank">http://www.w3.org</a> and their guidelines on accessibility: <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI" target="_blank">http://www.w3.org/WAI</a></p>
